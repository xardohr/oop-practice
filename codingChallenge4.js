// Coding Challenge #4

/*
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classses: create an "EVCL" class of the "CarCL" class
2. Make the "charge" property private
3. Implement the ability to chain the "acccelerate" and "chargeBattery" methods of this class, and also update the "brake" method in the Car class. They experiment with chining!

DATA CAR 1: "Rivian" going at 120km/h, with a charge of 23%

Good Luck âœŒ
